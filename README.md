Daily Check-Ins: Automatically performs check-ins every 24 hours.
Quiz Automation: Fetches quizzes and submits answers via Telegram buttons.
Data Masking: Protects sensitive information (emails and addresses).
Console Output: Displays results in a tabulated format with colored text.
Error Handling: Retries failed operations and logs issues gracefully.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:
Clone the Repository:

Customization: You can replace the placeholder banner image URL (https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=AriChain+Bot) with a custom image by hosting it somewhere (e.g., GitHub) and updating the link.
File Name: I assumed your script is index.js. Adjust references (e.g., node index.js) if it’s named differently.
